🌟 Hi there, I'm Büşranur Delice 👋
🎓 Medical Microbiology (MSc) & Nutrition and Dietetics (BSc, top of class)
🧬 Computational Biology & Bioinformatics Researcher
🤖 Machine Learning & AI Enthusiast
🔬 About Me
🧠 I specialize in multi-omics data integration (microbiome, proteomics, metabolomics) with neuroimaging (rs-fMRI) to study Parkinson’s Disease and cognitive impairment.
📊 Experienced in machine learning & deep learning (scikit-learn, PyTorch, Keras) for biomarker discovery and precision medicine.
🧪 Skilled in both wet-lab techniques (DNA/RNA extraction, PCR, ELISA, Western Blot, sequencing) and dry-lab analysis (QIIME2, HUMAnN3, MaxQuant, DIA-NN).
🖥️ Developed pipelines combining Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, LassoCV, Bayesian networks for biological data.
🌍 Currently applying to international PhD programs in computational biology & AI-driven life sciences.
🚀 Projects & Publications
🧬 Parkinson’s Disease multi-omics + neuroimaging integration → Machine learning model achieved AUC ~0.97.
🦎 Axolotl limb regeneration study → Microbiome & mycobiome restructuring with stage-specific dynamics (Wound Repair & Regeneration).
❤️ HeartHelper → AI-powered assistant for cardiovascular patients, developed at Google AI & Technology Academy.
